## Installing Cordova

To get our app running on the iOS simulator, do the following:

1. `npm install -g cordova` (or, if that fails `sudo npm install -g cordova`)
1. `cordova platform add ios` (or `cordova platform add android`)
1. `cordova emulate ios`

To build a new Cordova app from scratch, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/segdeha/whatineed/blob/master/CORDOVA.md).

To get our app running on an iOS device (i.e. your phone), you will need to be registered as an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/), then obtain a [provisioning profile](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3362652/what-is-a-provisioning-profile-used-for-when-developing-iphone-applications) for your device.

I havenâ€™t been able to get the app running yet on Android. ðŸ˜•
